// A string is a sequence of bytes that cannot be changed. Strings can contain any data
// and are generally used to save text.
//
// We generally use double quotes "" to define a string, but note that there are specific
// characters that have a specific meaning, which we call escaped characters, and these
// escaped characters contain:
//
// <pre style="font-size:small">
//   \n：line break
//   \r：Enter
//   \t：Tab
//   \u or \U：Unicode
//   \：Backslash
// </pre>

println("hello" + "\t" + "world") // hello   world

// If we want to know the length of the strings taken up by bytes, we can use Go+'s built-in
// functions to calculate it:

println(len("helloword")) // 9

// If we were to define a string, the grammar would be as follows:

str := "helloword"
println(str)      // helloword
println(len(str)) // 9

// We can stitch two strings together by +, appending the later string to the later of the
// earlier string.

str := "hello" + "word"
println(str) // helloword

str1 := "my name is \t"
str2 := "zs"

println(str1 + str2) // my name is      zs

// If we want to define a multi-line string, Go+ supports that too. Using the traditional
// "" is not possible across lines, we can use backquotes if we want to define a multi-line
// string: `

const str = `First line
Second line
Third line
`
println(str)

// The code between the backquotes is not recognized by the editor, but only as part of
// the string.

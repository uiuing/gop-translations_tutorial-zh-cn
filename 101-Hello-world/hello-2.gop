# The second type: function call style

println("Hello world")

// This way of writing is more like Python. The basis for understanding this kind of writing is
// to understand what is a function call. This understanding is not too difficult, especially
// if middle school students have learned functions (such as sin) in mathematics classes, it
// is relatively easy to understand. Most programming languages ​​also support this standard
// function call syntax.
